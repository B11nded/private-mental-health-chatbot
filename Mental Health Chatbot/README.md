# [Mental Health Chatbot]

[A mental health chatbot using openAI to speak conversationally or through text in a private one time-use chat.]

## Project Overview 

[A simple chatbot website that will start on a simple screen and then you can choose to either chat through voice or text(sms) style system. The chatbot will store no data and will completely end all memory once the chat is complete to ensure user privacy. It aims to maintain the privacy required in such a private field.]

## Features

- [Feature 1: Conversational back-and-forth both through text and voice]
- [Feature 2: Easy to use UI that is simple but understandable]
- [Feature 3: AI makes sure to alert the user they are not a health professional and explains the proper routes to take]
- [Feature 4: Careful consideration to prevent the AI from storing any information and preventing anyone from seeing conversations used through this AI]

## Future Features

- [Feature 1: Website will automatically ask if you would like to be transferred to the proper resources for your issue]
- [Feature 2: Info panels about the security aspects and what happens to their inputs]
